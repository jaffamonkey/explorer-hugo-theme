# Explorer Theme ðŸŒ±

Example starting page for your digital garden defined in `content/_index.md`. Note that in this page the right side menu is not 
present as the front-matter contains `ContentMenu = false`.

## Graph

This theme supports graph generation but that can be expensive to compute. For that reason, if you want to add a graph
representation of your notes add it manually by sing the short code `{{</* graph */>}}`.

{{< graph >}}
